# Engineering College Predictor

This project is a web-based application that assists aspiring engineering students in making informed decisions about their college options. The application intelligently filters and displays colleges based on specific criteria such as student MHT-CET rank, category, and branch preference, ensuring that students receive accurate and relevant information for their potential educational journey.
