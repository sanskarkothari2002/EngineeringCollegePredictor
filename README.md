# Engineering College Predictor

This project is a web application that assists aspiring engineering students in making informed decisions about their college choices. The application intelligently filters and displays colleges based on specific criteria such as student MHT-CET rank, category, and branch preference to ensure that students receive accurate and relevant information for their potential educational journey.
