# Engineering College Predictor

This project is a web application that helps aspiring engineering students make informed decisions about their college choices. The application intelligently filters and displays colleges based on specific criteria such as student MHT-CET rank, category, and branch preference to ensure that students receive accurate and relevant information for their potential educational journey.

# Problem Statement

Bridging the information gap in college selection for aspiring engineers, our web application aims to simplify the process, making it accessible to students in rural areas, and ensuring they receive pertinent details for informed decision-making.
